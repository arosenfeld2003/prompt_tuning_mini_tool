# Prompt Wrangler CLI

A command-line tool to interact with OpenAI's chat completion models for prompt engineering and structured data extraction (JSON).  The goal is analyzing clinical notes from doctors requesting DME.

## Approach

This tool provides a CLI to send prompts (system and user) along with input text to an OpenAI model (configurable, defaults to `gpt-4o-mini`). It's specifically set up to request JSON output from the model (`response_format={"type": "json_object"}`).

A testing script (`test_prompt_wrangler.py`) is included to evaluate default prompts against predefined examples, using `DeepDiff` to compare the actual JSON output against expected JSON. This allows for iterative refinement of the prompts based on test results.

## How to Run

1.  **Setup:**
    *   Clone the repository (if needed).
    *   Create and activate a Python virtual environment (e.g., `python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate`).
    *   Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
    *   Create a `.env` file in the project root with your OpenAI API key, as show in `.env_example`.

2.  **Run the CLI:**
    ```bash
    python prompt_wrangler_cli.py
    ```
    Follow the prompts to enter system/user prompts, input text, and model parameters. 
    
    **Notes:** 
    - When using custom prompts, ensure "json" appears in either the system or user prompt, as required by the API when `response_format={"type": "json_object"}` is used.
    - max_tokens applies only to the completion: The `max_tokens` parameter (defaulting to 250 in prompt_utils.py) limits how many tokens the AI is allowed to generate in its response.

3.  **Run Tests:**
    ```bash
    python test_prompt_wrangler.py
    ```
    Test results (including detailed diffs for failures) are saved to a timestamped log file in the `test_results/` directory. A summary is printed to the console.

## TODO (with more time)

*   Implement more robust and comprehensive test cases: fix failing tests, wider range of inputs and edge cases.
*   Save script output to a file or send directly to another data source.
*   Explore using the LLM itself to analyze test failures and suggest improvements to the prompts automatically.
*   Additional prompt engineering; potential use of RAG if we have known data sets of DME.
*   Add a frontend web UI for ease of use by non-engineers (people not comfortable with CLI).
